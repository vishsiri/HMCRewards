To use the Dynamic Reward system with the HMCRewardsCommand, you need to define rewards in your configuration, use a RewardProvider that supports dynamic rewards, and execute the appropriate command to queue or give rewards dynamically.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Define a Dynamic Reward in config.yml
Define the reward in the configuration file with all necessary attributes. Use arguments to define dynamic placeholders.

yaml
Copy code
rewards:
  example_dynamic_reward:
    type: dynamic
    display:
      material: 'CHEST'
      custom-model-data: 1
      name: '<green>Dynamic Reward Example'
      lore:
        - 'A dynamic reward!'
        - 'Configured with arguments!'
    arguments:
      arg_1:
        value: 64        # Default value for arg_1
        stackable: true
        stack-size: 64   # Max stack size
      arg_2:
        value: 32        # Default value for arg_2
        stackable: false # Cannot stack in inventory
    commands:
      - 'say %player% received %arg_1% diamonds and %arg_2% netherite ingots!'
      - 'minecraft:give %player% minecraft:diamond %arg_1%'
      - 'minecraft:give %player% minecraft:netherite_ingot %arg_2%'
2. Command Syntax
Use the hmcrewards queue command to queue or give a dynamic reward to a player.

Command Syntax
plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue <target> <provider> <reward_name> [dynamic_args]
<target>: The player’s name, @a for all players, or @e for all entities.
<provider>: The RewardProvider for dynamic rewards (e.g., dynamic).
<reward_name>: The reward reference in the config (e.g., example_dynamic_reward).
[dynamic_args]: Optional arguments to override defaults.
Examples
Queue with Default Values:

plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue PlayerName dynamic example_dynamic_reward
Uses default values:
arg_1 = 64
arg_2 = 32
Result:

Executes commands:
plaintext
Copy code
say PlayerName received 64 diamonds and 32 netherite ingots!
minecraft:give PlayerName minecraft:diamond 64
minecraft:give PlayerName minecraft:netherite_ingot 32
Override Default Values:

plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue PlayerName dynamic example_dynamic_reward -arg_1:128 -arg_2:16
Overrides:
arg_1 = 128
arg_2 = 16
Result:

Executes commands:
plaintext
Copy code
say PlayerName received 128 diamonds and 16 netherite ingots!
minecraft:give PlayerName minecraft:diamond 128
minecraft:give PlayerName minecraft:netherite_ingot 16
Force-Give Immediately:

plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue -f PlayerName dynamic example_dynamic_reward
Tries to give the reward immediately. If some items cannot be given due to inventory space, queues the rest.
3. Argument Parsing
The DynamicRewardProvider handles dynamic arguments using a format like -arg_name:value.

Argument Format: -arg_name:value[:stack_type]
arg_name: The argument name (e.g., arg_1).
value: The value to use for the argument.
stack_type (Optional): stack or non-stack.
Example with Stack Type:
plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue PlayerName dynamic example_dynamic_reward -arg_1:200:stack -arg_2:10:non-stack
arg_1 = 200 (stackable)
arg_2 = 10 (non-stackable)
Inventory Slot Calculation:

arg_1: Requires 4 slots (200 items, max stack size = 64).
arg_2: Requires 10 slots (non-stackable).
4. Reward Execution Flow
Command Handler:

The queue method in HMCRewardsCommand fetches the reward using the RewardProvider.
It parses dynamic arguments from the command.
Dynamic Argument Resolution:

Placeholders like %arg_1% and %arg_2% in the reward's commands are replaced with the provided values.
Inventory Slot Validation:

The DynamicRewardProvider checks if the player has enough inventory space.
If not, the reward is queued instead of given immediately.
Command Execution:

The commands in the reward are executed with placeholders replaced by resolved values.
5. Common Use Cases
Reward with Multiple Players:
plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue @a dynamic example_dynamic_reward
Queues the reward for all online players.
Offline Player Reward:
plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue VisherRyz dynamic example_dynamic_reward
Queues the reward for an offline player VisherRyz.
Test the Reward:
plaintext
Copy code
/hmcrewards queue YourName dynamic example_dynamic_reward -arg_1:50 -arg_2:5
Tests the reward with custom arguments.
